# HW8 — Problem 1

## Problem statement

Alice has been working with Boris, a renowned chess master, on a chess training software Boris is planning to use to prepare himself for the next Chess World Cup. Bob couldn't participate, but he's been talking to Alice about her project a lot lately, and was quitely working on something of his own. Yesterday, he finally revealed to you what he was working on — the beginnings of a chess simulation in C++ — as usual, because he needed your help.

Modify Bob's code [here](https://repl.it/@agurtovoy/hw8-problem1) ([`main.cpp`](main.cpp)) to finish his TODOs spelled out in the comments. Use your `point` and `rectangle` class definitions from [hw6/problem1](https://github.com/uiowa-cs-3210-0001/cs3210-assignments-fall2019/tree/master/hw6/problem1) to avoid re-implementing these classes. Pay attention to run-time `assert` failures; do not remove the asserts.
