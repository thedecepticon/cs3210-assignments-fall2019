# HW5 â€” Problem 2

## Problem statement

Alice came by while you were working on Bob's [`point` type](https://github.com/uiowa-cs-3210-0001/cs3210-assignments-fall2019/tree/master/hw5/problem1), watched you for a couple of minutes, and said: "You know, I've been thinking of creating a tiny geometry library for working with points and rectangles. I already wrote the tests for it, do you want to take it over?" In a brief moment of madness, you enthusiastically agreed.

Use Alice's code [here](https://repl.it/@agurtovoy/hw5-problem2) ([`main.cpp`](main.cpp)) and your solution for [hw5/problem1](https://github.com/uiowa-cs-3210-0001/cs3210-assignments-fall2019/tree/master/hw5/problem1) as a starting point. Remember that the same feature that allows us to define multiple identically named functions in the same scope also allows us to define multiple constructors within the same `struct`.
