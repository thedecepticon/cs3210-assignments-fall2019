# HW6 â€” Problem 1

## Problem statement

"Nice work," said Alice, looking over your code from [hw5/problem2](https://github.com/uiowa-cs-3210-0001/cs3210-assignments-fall2019/tree/master/hw5/problem2). "I wrote some more tests for you," she continued, "Do you think you can make them pass?" Inexplicably, you nodded yes.

Use Alice's updated tests [here](https://repl.it/@agurtovoy/hw6-problem1) ([`main.cpp`](main.cpp)) and your solutions for [hw5/problem1](https://github.com/uiowa-cs-3210-0001/cs3210-assignments-fall2019/tree/master/hw5/problem1) and [hw5/problem2](https://github.com/uiowa-cs-3210-0001/cs3210-assignments-fall2019/tree/master/hw5/problem2) as a starting point. The stream output operator can have the same canonical signature we familiarized ourselves with during class because `std::ostringstream` is a subclass of `std::ostream`.
