# HW4 â€” Problem 2

## Problem statement

Bob, Alice's coworker, challenged you to modify your solution to [lab5-exercise3](https://repl.it/@agurtovoy/lab5-exercise3) to ask the user to make the selection until they make one of the correct choices. You accepted. 

Use the modified problem template [here](https://repl.it/@agurtovoy/hw4-problem2) ([`main.cpp`](main.cpp)) as a starting point. Feel free to define new functions to better structure your code.
